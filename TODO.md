# TODO

1. Extend the README file
    - explain the idea
    - point the main files
2. Delete `src` and `tests`
3. Add slide about Roche (a screenshot from one of the external presentation will be fine)
4. Export the notebook in PDF format
5. Publish to GitHub
6. Add a QR code to the GitHub repository
7. Promote the meetup on Twitter, maybe LinkedIn too
